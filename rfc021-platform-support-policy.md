Title: Chef Platform Support Policy
Status: Accepted
Type: Informational

# Chef Platform Policy

The purpose of this RFC is to clarify which platforms the Chef community chooses to work on, and how those platforms are maintained.

The [chef docs site](https://docs.chef.io/) has [details of the platforms Chef Software, Inc validates for release](https://docs.chef.io/platforms.html).

# Types of Support

This RFC outlines the process for community support of a platforms on Chef, but it's worth noting the distinction between community supported and Chef Software Inc. supported:

- Commercial Support consists of the platforms that are supported as part of a paid commercial support contract with Chef Software Inc. For a complete list of commercially supported platforms see the [Chef Platform Support Docs ](https://docs.chef.io/platforms.html).
- Community Support is made up of platforms for which support is only available through the Chef community on a best effort basis.

# Adding a new platform

Community maintenance of a platform requires that core chef resources,
including `package`, `file`, and `service`, MUST have working providers
for the platform. For example, on Debian the package provider supports both
`dpkg` and `apt`. Ohai MUST also be able to gather relevant information on
the platform such as platform information, cpu type/count, and available memory.

In addition to support in code, there SHOULD be a Lieutenant for the
platform, per RFC 30. There MAY also be one or more Maintainers for the
platform. The Lieutenant and any Maintainers are responsible for
reviewing RFCs and code that affects the platform, and SHOULD be
responsible for ensuring that new versions of the platform are
supported.

# Platform Support EOL Policy

The Chef community will support a given platform version until the vendor's EOL
date for that platform version. Because different vendors use different
terminology, the following table clarifies when Chef products are end-of-life
according to those vendorsâ€™ terms:

Platform | Vendor End of Life
---- | ---
AIX | IBM End of Support Date
Debian | End of maintenance updates
Enterprise Linux (covers RedHat Enterprise Linux, CentOS) | End of Production 3
Fedora | End of Life
FreeBSD | End of Life
Microsoft Windows | End of Extended Support
openSUSE | End of Life
Oracle Enterprise Linux | Premier Support Ends
Oracle Solaris | Premier Support Ends
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server | General Support Ends
Ubuntu Linux | End of maintenance updates
